%Has some examples with reformulating temporal logic into past-time view for Lustre.
% Temporal logic SL has previous operator from TLP defined as `ᐧp = false -> pre p`, while its dual `not ᐧ (not p)` is true on first instance.
Since is encoded as `p S q = ∃x. x = (q \/ (p /\ ᐧx))`.

% Introduces a temporal logic with past and future. Primitives are strong next, strong previous, (strong) until, and (strong) since.
% Weak next, weak previous, eventually, globally, past-eventually ("sometime in the past") and past-globally ("always in the past") can be defined in terms of the primitives.
% The subset with only past and no future operators is called "TLP", subset with only future is called "TLF".
