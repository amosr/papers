\section{Extraction}
\label{s:extraction}

Pipit can generate executable code which is suitable for real-time execution on embedded devices.
The code extraction uses a variation of the abstract transition system described in \autoref{s:transition}, with two main differences to ensure that the result is executable without relying on the environment to provide values for the free context.
Contracts are straightforward to execute by using the body of the contract rather than abstracting over the implementation.

To execute recursive expressions $\xrec{x}{e} : \tau$, we require an arbitrary value of type $\tau$ to seed the fixpoint, as described in \autoref{s:core:causality}.
We first call the step function to evaluate $e$ with $x$ bound to $\bot_\tau$.
This step call returns the correct value, but the updated state is invalid, as it may refer to the bottom value.
To get the correct state, we call the step function again, this time with $e$ bound to $v$.

This translation to transition systems is verified to preserve the original semantics.
The invariant is very similar to that of \autoref{s:transition:proof}, except that the invariant descends into the implementations of contracts.
For the abstract systems we only showed abstraction; to prove that executable systems are equivalent to the original semantics, we rely on the fact that the original semantics and transition systems are both deterministic and total (\autoref{s:core:causality}).

To extract the program, we use a \emph{hybrid embedding} as described in \cite{ho2022noise}, which is similar to staged-compilation.
The hybrid embedding involves a deep embedding of the Pipit core language, while the translation to executable transition systems produces a shallow embedding.
We use the \fstar{} host language's normalisation-by-evaluation and tactic support~\cite{martinez2019meta} to specialise the application of the translation to a particular input program.
This specialisation results in a concrete transition system that fits in the \lowstar{} subset of \fstar{}, which can then be extracted to statically-allocated C code~\cite{protzenko2017verified}.

The translation for recursive streams described above calls the step function of the sub-stream twice, which can duplicate work.
The normalisation strategy used to partially-evaluate the translation inlines the two occurrences of the step function, and is often able to remove the duplicate work, but this removal is not guaranteed.
Our current approach is also unsuitable for generating imperative array code, as our shallowly-embedded pure transition system requires pure arrays.
In the future, we intend to address array computations and the above work duplication by introducing an intermediate imperative language such as Obc~\cite{biernacki2008clock}, a static object-based language suitable for synchronous systems.
Even with an added intermediate language, we believe that a variant of our current translation and proof-of-correctness will remain useful as an intermediate semantics.
% We currently generate a monolithic step function for each Pipit program; we hope that an embedded foreign-function interface similar to that used by Accelerate~\cite{clifton2014embedding} may also enable separate-compilation of programs.
