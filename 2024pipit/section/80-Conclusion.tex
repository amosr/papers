\section{Conclusion}

Our preliminary results show that \fstar{}'s proof automation and code extraction are suitable for verifying reactive systems and executing them in real-time; these results still require further work.
Next, we intend to verify the imperative code generation.
To verify large programs, we also need some way to separately prove smaller pieces which can then be composed together, such as contracts~\cite{champion2016kind2}.
Finally, we need to evaluate Pipit on larger control systems before extending the language to support more features, such as Lustre's clocks for describing partially-defined streams~\cite{caspi1995functional}.

% TODO
% Future work: verify imperative code generation; verify CSE; case studies: antilock braking; clocks \cite{caspi1995functional}; contracts \cite{champion2016kind2}.
