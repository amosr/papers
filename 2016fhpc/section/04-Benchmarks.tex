\section{Benchmarks}
\label{s:Benchmarks}

We are using Icicle in production, over medium-sized datasets that fit on a single disk.

One evaluation we performed was replacing a hand-written R script which had been running in production.
This R script works over around three hundred gigabytes of PSV data.
It computes twelve queries over each of the thirty-one input tables, computing 372 queries in total.

The R script for this takes around fifteen hours to run and is 3,566 lines, 2,311 of which are code.
In contrast, our Icicle queries take eleven minutes to run, and the dictionary describing the queries is 191 lines of code.

\begin{code}
          R       Icicle
Minutes   900         11
LOC       2,311      191
MB/s      6.6        543
\end{code}


Run some benchmarks.

\begin{code}
        grep "^$"   wc    wc -l   Icicle
MB/s      74        251   775       1,060
\end{code}
