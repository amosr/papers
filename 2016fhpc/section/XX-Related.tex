``most compilers restrict themselves to common subexpression elimination within basic blocks or extended basic blocks''
\cite{debray1992compiler}

Temporal common subexpression elimination in Single Assignment C
allows reuse of expressions computed in the previous iteration\cite{imlig2001loop}.
This is a more general case of the elimination opportunities that arise from loop unrolling.

For example, the program below loops over an array @A@, and stores the product @a@ of some computation on the current element (@f(A[i])@), while performing the same computation over the next element (@f(A[i+1])@) and summing it in @b@.
On successive iterations, the @bx = f(A[i+1])@ computed from last iteration could be reused as the new @ax = f(A[i])@.
\begin{code}
int[] A;
int a = 1;
int b = 0;
while(int i = 0; i != size - 1; i++)  {
  int ax = f(A[i]);
  int bx = f(A[i+1]);
  a += ax;
  b *= bx;
}
\end{code}

I cannot think of a better example than this right now.

Continuous queries are a similar domain, where a single query keeps running and producing results, as data is received.
In \cite{munagala2007optimization} there are multiple queries based off the same incoming stream.
Each queries is filtered by a conjunction of predicates, where each single predicate may be used by multiple queries.
If these predicates are expensive to compute, it is certainly not ideal to compute these for each query.

Multi-query data analysis\cite{andrade2003efficient} describes a similar problem, where they have multiple queries over the same data that run periodically.
By grouping the multiple queries together, more optimisations can be performed than when treating the queries separately.
This is a lot closer, and performs CSE on expressions like @x = sum(y)@, where @sum@ is a built-in aggregate function.
However, this is only for a small set of built-in aggregates, and does not deal with mutually recursive
