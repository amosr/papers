``most compilers restrict themselves to common subexpression elimination within basic blocks or extended basic blocks''
\cite{debray1992compiler}

Temporal common subexpression elimination in Single Assignment C
allows reuse of expressions computed in the previous iteration\cite{imlig2001loop}.
This is a more general case of the elimination opportunities that arise from loop unrolling.

For example, the program below loops over an array @A@, and stores the product @a@ of some computation on the current element (@f(A[i])@), while performing the same computation over the next element (@f(A[i+1])@) and summing it in @b@.
On successive iterations, the @bx = f(A[i+1])@ computed from last iteration could be reused as the new @ax = f(A[i])@.
\begin{code}
int[] A;
int a = 1;
int b = 0;
while(int i = 0; i != size - 1; i++)  {
  int ax = f(A[i]);
  int bx = f(A[i+1]);
  a += ax;
  b *= bx;
}
\end{code}

I cannot think of a better example than this right now.
