% Scheduling is undecidable in general
% Boolean dataflow
% It's all about taking a graph that contains irregular/not-synchronous actors, and putting
% these irregular subgraphs into clusters so that, viewed externally, they are regular (1 in 1 out).
% So looking at an if implemented as something like
% (switch P; (T | F); select)
% the T and the F aren't regular, but the whole thing taken together forms a regular graph.
% But you're using a more expressive language - switches and selects and madness - when
% you really want to restrict these to only be used in structured ways.

% Integer dataflow
% Clustering to find control structure: tries to recover structures like ifs, cases and loops
% from the dataflow graph.
% Extends previous (buck1993scheduling) with loops that repeat some number of times, and multi-way ifs
% Very rigid and only supports limited control flow structures.
% Unclear how a merge or append would be clustered by this system.

% Good comparison of different kinds of dataflow networks.

% Boundedness and liveness for BDF and IDF are undecidable, but
% static analysis can be done for many `practical problems'.
% Deals with dynamic scheduling, with some static schedules for particular cases
